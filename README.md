# Event Center
---
The point of this project was to create a html website for an event center of our choosing using HTML and CSS.

## Index Page
This is the home page. User can access all pages through the Nav bar. This page contains a welcome message and a banner

## Event Page
This is the event page. It gives a description of three events that will be happening at the Blossom Center. Click on the info circle for more detail

## Menu Page
This page contains the items that you can buy at Blossom to eat. 

## Location Page
This page contains the location and hours of operation at Blossom.

## Contact Us Page
This pages allows the user to contact us with any questions they may have.

## Biggest Challenge
The biggest challenge of this program was using css styles to get the overall look I wanted. The menu table is the item that I spent the most time on.

## What did I learn?
I learned that once you get a uniform style it is easier to add the details you need later.
